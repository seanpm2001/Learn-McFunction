# About:
# I decided to make mcfunction the main project language file for this project (Seanpm2001/Learn-mcfunction) as mcfunction is the language this project is dedicated to, because this project is about learning the mcfunction programming language. It only makes sense to mcfunction the official language for this project. It is getting its own project language file, starting here.
